    "description": "Cinematography holds a significant place in my journey, tracing back to 1995 when I embarked on my path as a videographer in my home country, Albania. Born as the son of Ibrahim Berdaku, a renowned writer and director in Albania, my upbringing was steeped in the artistry of filmmaking.\n\nMy exposure to my father’s world ignited a lifelong passion for the cinematic arts. With a rich tapestry of more than two decades in international video production, I take immense pride in my role as a catalyst for amplifying the reach of the brands I’ve collaborated with, resulting in audiences that have expanded into the millions.\n\nServing as the Head of Production at Ajvideo Productions Inc., I have orchestrated a diverse array of projects, spanning from grand-scale affairs like NYC Media, Mediakite, Thom Browne, Prada, Calvin Klein, Ferrari, Sothebys, Phillips, Miu Miu, Proenza, Philipp Plein, Gabriella Hearst, SKY TG24, RAI, Mediaset, and LA7, to corporate gatherings. My innate ability to anticipate and encapsulate fleeting, enchanting moments, all while maintaining an unobtrusive presence, sets me apart.\n\nMoreover, I possess the unique gift of being trilingual, proficient in English, Italian, and Albanian, which further enriches my ability to connect with and understand diverse cultures and audiences. I am confident that my professional prowess behind the camera, coupled with my extensive experience and unwavering dedication to client satisfaction, renders me an invaluable asset to your esteemed production crew.",

Given the tension and heated rhetoric surrounding current debates on immigration issues, it is crucial to provide a genuine platform for individuals to tell their stories and help people understand the human beings behind these complex and often abstract policy issues. \n",

    "description": "Ryan is a New York-based filmmaker with a flair for turning subtle, everyday moments into compelling stories with broad appeal, particularly through the universal language of sports.\n\nHis journey behind the camera began on the sidelines of high school football games in Texas. As he moved on to film and documentary work, Ryan developed a profound belief in the power of empathy, drawing from a tapestry of his own diverse human experiences that would inspire his approach to narratives that resonate deeply and authentically.\n\nEducated at NYU's graduate film program, Ryan's foundation in filmmaking is robust, recognized by industry accolades such as the Best Test Commercial at YDA in Cannes for his Nike spot \"Buckets\". His debut transcends the arena of sports, offering a lens into the human condition and capturing the collective ethos that brands and agencies strive to embody.\n\nWith an eye for the emotive force of storytelling, Ryan’s ambition is to craft campaigns that don't just sell, but also tell a story that audiences will remember and feel a part of. His vision for the future is expansive, seeking to collaborate on projects that challenge societal norms and ignite conversations.\n\nBrands and agencies should partner with Ryan for his fresh perspective that blends the traditional with the avant-garde, his commitment to authenticity, and his proven ability to connect with viewers on an emotional level. His work is a testament to the potential of creative advertising to not just reach an audience, but to touch it profoundly.\n\nWhen not weaving narratives, Ryan is usually cooking at home in Brooklyn, or exploring the world’s coastlines with his fiancée Stephanie.",

        "description": "Ismail Matar is a Palestinian refugee and an artist — and the streets of Gaza City are his canvas.\n\nBorn and raised in the Khan Younis refugee camp, Ismail has lived his entire life in a war zone — but he strives to bring hope and joy to his community through his artwork.\n\nIn May 2021, the Israeli military carried out 11 days of airstrikes in Gaza, killing at least 260 Palestinians, 66 of whom were children. The attacks also destroyed countless homes and buildings, and much of Ismail’s street art became rubble.\n\nFor Ismail, rebuilding Gaza City, his home, means painting new images of hope and humanity in Palestine. Today, he helps children use art to channel their feelings and process their grief and trauma so that they can build a brighter future for themselves.\n\n“We have dreams and ambitions,” he said. “We want to live with dignity.”",

    "description": "There are only two major documentary shows produced in Ukraine that I haven't been part of. Netflix's 'Winter on fire' and BBC's Ukrainian episode of the 'Top gear'. The first one didn't need me being based at the real-time footage filmed by more than 100 video streamers of the Maidan Revolution in 2014. The second one turned out to be dull. 'The Russian Woodpecker' about Chernobyl zone which was also advertised as something big coming from Ukraine is more of a sensationalist trick rather than a documentary. Each and every big Western documentary production company working in Ukraine has hired me to do the job.\n\nMajor works are listed on my IMDB profile and at my agency's website.\nIMDB profile: imdb.com/name/nm3002393\nWebsite: fixerukraine.com\n \nI've worked as a local producer/ fixer for the majority of the Vice's shows in Ukraine including 'Cold War 2.0', 'Black Market', 'Cyberwar', 'Gaycation' and 'World in Disarray', BBC's 'The Great Continental Railway Show with Michael Portillo' and 'Inside Chernobyl's Megatomb', Chernobyl's episode of the 'Abandoned Engineering' fro Discovery, History's 'Cities of Underworld' and many more. \n\nHere is short CV:\n2014 - 2018 - full-time freelance local producer/ fixer (NBC, NatGeo, Vice, BBC, AJ, Discovery, RTL4, BNN Vara etc.)\n\n2014 - 2016 - producer (Vocativ) \n\n2004 - 2014 - part-time fixer for Western media/ television director & presenter for local media (1+1, STB, New Channel)  \n\n2002 - 2004 - E.Muskie program fellow (Ohio University Graduate Media Arts program)   \n\n1998 - 2004 - journalist for the major Ukrainian television companies (1+1, First National Channel, Inter)    ",

At that moment began an adventure that took me around the world. Thanks to my work on an international television network, I was able to cover events such as the earthquake in Haiti in 2010, the Egyptian revolution in 2011, the wars between Israel and Hamas, the visit of Pope Francis to Holy Land and the funerals of Ariel Sharon and Hugo Chavez. Afterwards, in 2015, my report in Nigeria on Boko Haram was selected for the Emmy Awards.\n\nFor years I have worked in front of the camera as a reporter, presenter and interviewer, but also a lot behind it, because I have been producing reports and documentaries on a free-lance basis for a long time.\n\nI do all kinds of video production, journalistic or commercial, for a wide range of clients: media, institutions, NGO and companies.\n\nBesides, I shoot and edit all my work with my own professional equipment and the know-how from two decades of experience in TV.\n\nRestless by nature, I’ve also been a professional photographer since the 1990s. At the end of 2001 I created in Barcelona, together with the French photographer, Jean Pierre Porcher, the photo agency, Gran Angular.\n\nI am also a drone operator. Have all the official diplomas to fly drones up to 2 kg in any European country.",

    "description": "I'm a freelance filmmaker and video journalist focused primarily on documentary projects. I'm currently picking up short-term gigs as a Freelance Producer, Editor, or Videographer while I work on a part-time commissioned short documentary based out of Nebraska.\n\nI most recently finished working on a project with production company Meerkat Media on a commission from Sesame Street in Communities. The project entails documentary-style educational videos about how to talk to kids about race and racism through observing real families in conversation with their children.\n\nPrior to delving into full-time freelance life, I worked as an Associate Producer on seven feature-length historic documentaries produced by CNN Specials as well as an observational film produced by HBO Max/CNN Films.\n\nIndependently, with my production partner Sana A. Malik, I produced, shot, and edited the student BAFTA-award winning documentary, Guanajuato Norte. The film follows a migrant farmworker in Connecticut and his sacrifice of being away from his family to provide a better life for his children. The film went on to screen multiple film festivals and was acquired by The New Yorker’s Documentary Channel.\n\nI also co-directed the short film, Chief Standing Bear's Journey to Statuary Hall, for the Nebraska Commission on Indian Affairs with Judi gaiashkibos (co-director and EP.) Together, we made a film to be used as an educational resource, following the historical story of Ponca Chief Standing Bear and the modern-day journey of building a statue of his likeness to stand in the U.S. Capitol.\n\nIn addition to working as a Director/Producer on commissioned short films and personal projects, I love helping established Director’s visions come to life as an Associate Producer, Editor, or Second Camera. I’m easily curious but particularly drawn toward stories about migration, family, social justice, and the meaning of home.",

His curiosity drove him to enroll at Columbia College Chicago, where he worked as a sound designer for various films -- including several that won in the Chicago International Film Festival and other independent festivals. He also worked on numerous projects as a location sound recorder. His talents took him to Sri Lanka, Miami, and Wyoming, where he was exposed to incredible learning experiences in sound.\nAfter graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in Audio for Visual Arts in 2015,  A.J. landed an internship at NoiseFloor Ltd., where he quickly became acclimated to the professional clientele and workflow. His dedication and passion for the business earned him a promotion as a Sound Editor, which put him on larger scale projects like web & TV spots for OtterBox, Honda, and Special Olympics, the short TV show The Jamz, and the video game Injustice 2. His location audio career has also grown as he’s worked on projects such as Restore Hair Restoration with Brian Urlacher, Family Travels with Colleen Kelly and the United States Marine drum and bugle corps. He’s even had the opportunity to record Wayne Brady for a SEG TV & Radio spot.\nThough his career is just beginning, A.J. has already traveled to New York, London, Maryland, and San Francisco as a location sound recorder and worked on multiple large scale projects in he River North studios. He takes each day as a learning opportunity and plans on seeing more success at NoiseFloor.",

I studied International Journalism at Cardiff University, where I graduated with a distinction.\n\nMy main area of interest lies in geopolitics and human rights. I  investigated the effects of religious nationalism in Armenia, questioning democratic processes and the roles played by the church in society and politics.\n\nI have shot and edited stories on refugees from Calais to Cardiff, but also covered cultural topics from sneaker trends to the art of graffiti. \n\nFormer BMX-race athlete, I am a sport-addicted which led me to cover women and girls in sport and other punchy stories including on the business of Mixed Martial Arts. \n\nBy nature, I am curious and adventurous, I like to observe new cultures and to learn from people. Having travelled in many countries, I have a multicultural and open-minded perspective of the world: I understand four languages. For me, journalism is a field of exploration and encounters. I like to listen, to feel, to perceive, to shoot pictures and to transcribe the experience by sharing these impressions through reporting.\n\nI am currently working for France24  for the French and the English channels. My reports have been published by InsideOver, Voice Of America, and Worldcrunch.  I also used to work for several magazines and newspaper in France including L’Équipe, Courrier International and Le Dauphiné Libéré. I also used to be a reporter for the Paris-based Institute Open Diplomacy.\n\nAs a young woman, I want to prove to my generation why journalism matters. I am convinced that understanding our environment requires a thorough study of the world. I believe journalism is a means of involvement and engagement. I want to share with society my passion for international news, and to convince others of its importance.\nDetermination, tenacity and optimism drive my everyday life!",

This disturbing phenomenon is due to accidental catches by non-selective fishing gear. About 200,000 dolphins live in the Bay of Biscay, but rights groups fear the species will be driven to the brink of extinction. The European Commission already put France on notice in 2020 for its ineffectiveness in saving dolphins, an animal essential to the ecosystem and one that's strictly protected under European and French law. The government has now implemented an action plan. But will it be effective? FRANCE 24's Jade Lévin report.",

Ces décharges sauvages nuisent à la biodiversité et participent au réchauffement climatique par l'émission de gaz à effet de serre. Le collectif \"La Brigade écologiste\" lutte pour retrouver les pollueurs, passibles de 75 000 euros d'amende et deux ans de prison.",

The results can be harmless (a floral print dress), catastrophic (nuclear bombs), noble (maintaining national parks), or complicated (upsetting natural cycles of life and death while managing fires in Aspen). Falling somewhere between documentary, personal research project, podcast, and performance video, Wild Human uses unorthodox storytelling to indulge in philosophical questions, quirky history, and a bit of doomsaying in analyzing humanity’s loss of wilderness and its piecemeal reconstruction.\n\nA theme of iterative destruction, masking, and alteration of “the wild” arises when exploring topics such as hidden sites on Google Maps, virtual reality, ghost towns, and systems that damage or re-contextualize the natural world like war and the stock market. A diverse pool of media is utilized from Youtube fail videos to archival footage to beautiful sequences filmed during road trips through Colorado, Utah, and Arizona.",

I love shaping a story, shooting and been in the field, interviewing, and everything else content gathering entails. There's something athletic in the act. You put your whole body and mind into it. It's exhausting but tremendously fulfilling. \n\nI enjoy enormously assembling the puzzle of what a multimedia story is. Reviewing and selecting material, deciding which asset is best to convey what the story portrays. It's like writing, but far better. You can have the most beautiful images and incredible bits of audio, but if you don't know how to order them and ultimately make sense of them for the viewer, it's useless. It's like loose words on a piece of paper. That's what I love about editing: you're creating a language. It's a full on mind game.\n\nMultimedia is the type of work that I love engaging with and doing, but also the type of work that I think is meaningful and can promote change. I firmly believe is a medium that can reach people and spur them to understand issues fully and, consequently help bring change, especially when done with dedication and quality.",

    "description": "Ryan is a New York-based filmmaker with a flair for turning subtle, everyday moments into compelling stories with broad appeal, particularly through the universal language of sports.\n\nHis journey behind the camera began on the sidelines of high school football games in Texas. As he moved on to film and documentary work, Ryan developed a profound belief in the power of empathy, drawing from a tapestry of his own diverse human experiences that would inspire his approach to narratives that resonate deeply and authentically.\n\nEducated at NYU's graduate film program, Ryan's foundation in filmmaking is robust, recognized by industry accolades such as the Best Test Commercial at YDA in Cannes for his Nike spot \"Buckets\". His debut transcends the arena of sports, offering a lens into the human condition and capturing the collective ethos that brands and agencies strive to embody.\n\nWith an eye for the emotive force of storytelling, Ryan’s ambition is to craft campaigns that don't just sell, but also tell a story that audiences will remember and feel a part of. His vision for the future is expansive, seeking to collaborate on projects that challenge societal norms and ignite conversations.\n\nBrands and agencies should partner with Ryan for his fresh perspective that blends the traditional with the avant-garde, his commitment to authenticity, and his proven ability to connect with viewers on an emotional level. His work is a testament to the potential of creative advertising to not just reach an audience, but to touch it profoundly.\n\nWhen not weaving narratives, Ryan is usually cooking at home in Brooklyn, or exploring the world’s coastlines with his fiancée Stephanie.",

    "description": "After graduating from film school and before immersing myself in the documentary world, I began working as a correspondent for Associated Press Television at the age of 24. That journey included nearly 13 years of work and training in breaking news. I had the opportunity to cover stories in extraordinary places and meet fascinating people.\n\nThe genesis of my career was influenced by a family connection to journalism - I grew up hearing stories from my uncle Hermes, a war correspondent for NBC. He covered events such as the Gulf War, Sarajevo, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Cuba. His experiences inspired me to embark on my own travels and stories, much like he did.\n\nAs time went on, I gained more experience and realized that my destiny was not to cover wars and conflicts. My projects and concerns have always been related to social awareness, with a focus on making a positive impact on the audience. I began to search for the best way to use my passion and creativity to make films that truly make a difference. \n\nIn 2014, the combination of my Academy training in documentary and my curiosity for new ways of telling stories pulled me away from the breaking news cycle. I then adapted my journalism experience into a modern storytelling style that takes advantage of the often unique opportunities we have to get a shot that dramatically moves the story forward. As a documentary director and DOP, I'm constantly looking for artistic balance and social impact in my stories. \n\nBased in Buenos Aires, Argentina, my projects demonstrate a deep concern and commitment to social issues and justice. Today I direct documentaries with a deeply personal approach and help others raise their voices. Combining teamwork and expertise, I work comfortable into sensitive stories which require strong visuals with limited budget and timing.",

The attacks also destroyed countless homes and buildings, and much of Ismail’s street art became rubble.\n\nFor Ismail, rebuilding Gaza City, his home, means painting new images of hope and humanity in Palestine. Today, he helps children use art to channel their feelings and process their grief and trauma so that they can build a brighter future for themselves.\n\n“We have dreams and ambitions,” he said. “We want to live with dignity.”",

The Soviet dictator acted in concert with Great Britain, which also announced its military presence in Iran. The allied powers explained these actions by the fact that they want to minimize Hitler's influence in this part of Asia. They promised that as soon as Nazi Germany was defeated, the troops would leave Iran. But for the USSR, this became a convenient pretext for putting pressure on its southern neighbor. At the end of World War II, Stalin wanted to get oil concessions in Iran. When the country's leadership refused to do so, he began to blackmail the Iranian government with the creation of an independent Azerbaijani state in northern Iran. The confrontation between the USSR and Iran became the first chapter in the long history of international conflicts in which the leading world powers found themselves on opposite sides.",

Just 20 years ago, however, the production of argan oil was isolated to villagers in Morocco, who sold it locally for as little at $3 per liter. But since then, the formation of women-run cooperatives has transformed the production into a billion-dollar industry. With the help of the cooperatives, the traditional skills held by the Amazigh women has created some financial independence in a male-dominated society However, the women normally make less than $220 a month — below Morocco's recommended national minimum wage. So why has argan oil suddenly gained such popularity? And what makes it so expensive?\n",
